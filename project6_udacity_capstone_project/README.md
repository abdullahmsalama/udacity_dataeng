Welcome to my capstone project as a part of data engineering nanodegree at Udacity!. 

The main file is Capstone_Project.ipynb. The steps are explained in-detail inside using markdown cells.

The project organization needs to be agressively refactored to also cut the jupyter notebook to smaller functions/tasks, so I am working on it :)
